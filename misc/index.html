<h3>Invictus</h3>
<pre>
Out of the night that covers me, 
&nbsp; Black as the pit from pole to pole, 
I thank whatever gods may be 
&nbsp; For my unconquerable soul. 

In the fell clutch of circumstance 
&nbsp; I have not winced nor cried aloud. 
Under the bludgeonings of chance 
&nbsp; My head is bloody, but unbowed. 

Beyond this place of wrath and tears 
&nbsp; Looms but the Horror of the shade, 
And yet the menace of the years 
&nbsp; Finds and shall find me unafraid. 

It matters not how strait the gate, 
&nbsp; How charged with punishments the scroll, 
I am the master of my fate, 
&nbsp; I am the captain of my soul. 
</pre>
